It's always confusing and scary to start something new, mostly because you simply don't know where to begin. Hopefully, it's not as complicated as you might think. In this post, I listed several resources that will help you to master iOS development.

## 1. Learn Swift

A nice way to start iOS development is by learning Swift. There is no need to acquire Objective-C for beginners(although you may) because Swift is not a 'new player' anymore. Here are some great free resources: 

* For beginners: the "100 Days of Swift" by Paul Hudson. It is a collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more. 
* For people with a programming background: Apple official documentation. This book is a comprehensive and clear explanation of the language's main features and syntax. 


## 2. Explore Further

Once you finish learning Swift, you will start developing small projects using UIKit and more advanced tools. 

![image-left](/assets/images/instagram/ray.png){: .align-left} <a href="https://raywenderlich.com" target="_blank">**raywenderlich.com**</a> is a great website with an enormous database of video courses and tutorials on almost every topic of iOS development.

Another good starting point for beginners is AppCoda. It contains helpful tutorials and books with step-by-step explanations.

There are free video courses on iOS development by Stanford University on YouTube. You might want to check those out too! 



## SwiftUI vs UIKit
SwiftUI and UIKit are two different frameworks for building an iOS app's interface. Eventually, you will have to decide what you want to learn first, and I advise you to start with UIKit. There are several reasons for that: 
1. SwiftUI is relatively new, so it has some limitations
2. Working with UIKit using Interface Builder is more intuitive for beginners
3. UIKit is still used in most applications 


## Be Brave! 
There are plenty of other fantastic ways to learn iOS development which you can find by simply surfing the web. You can choose from tons of YouTube videos to Apple's docs and WWDC sessions. 
Don't be scared to explore and learn from multiple sources because this way, you deepen your understanding of the topics.

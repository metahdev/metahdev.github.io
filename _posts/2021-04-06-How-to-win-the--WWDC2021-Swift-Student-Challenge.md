WWDC 2021 is coming this June, in an all-online format. Apple also announced that this year’s Swift Student Challenge, an opportunity for young developers to demonstrate their coding skills by creating a Swift playground, is now accepting submissions. In this post, I will give some tips on how to win this year's contest.

## Important info 
In case you aren’t sure what I am talking about - you can read <a href="developer.apple.com/wwdc21/swift-student-challenge/" target="_blank">this page</a> for more information about the contest. 


## Developing a playground 
Developing a creative playground is challenging. However, it is possible. Here is how you can do it: 

1. Pick an ambitious idea  
2. Think of a unique project 
3. Try to use Apple’s promising frameworks(SwiftUI, ARKit, etc.) 


## How to write the essays
Here are the rules I followed while writing my submission essays: 

 * Academic writing style 
 * Avoiding clichés
 * Being honest(you can provide links at the end of the essay) 


## My 2020 submission 
 Last year, I was lucky enough to be the winner of WWDC20 SSC. My submission was a simulator of Kazakh national instrument - Dombra. The main functionality of the app is the ability to play on the instrument. I also provided some information about dombra, added a metronome feature. 

Overall, the project isn’t especially technically complex: the idea itself, in my opinion, was the reason why I have been awarded last year.

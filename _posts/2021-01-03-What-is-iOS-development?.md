## Cracking the mystery

Before we start learning about iOS development, you have to know what it is, right? Well, iOS development is a 'fancy' word for creating applications on iPhone/iPad. 

But how do you make a mobile app? As with any other application, it's done by programming, which is to put simply, means writing a bunch of commands(code) to the computer. Machines don't understand human languages, so we communicate with them using programming languages. 


## Important terminology

There are several definitions you have to become acquainted with to understand upcoming information: 
* **macOS** - an operating system of Mac computers 
* **Swift**(yup, that bird on my logo) - a programming language used to write programs on macOS, iOS, watchOS, etc. 
* **Xcode** - a macOS application for iOS development where all the magic happens. 


## How does the process look?

Every step of iOS development is done in the Xcode. Here is how it looks:

Usually, when you work as an iOS developer, you are not designing the app's interface. It's done by a UI designer. Most of the time, you will create the functionality of the project by writing code. 


## Confused? That's okay! 

If you have no programming background, everything may seem complicated now, and it's completely normal. 

In that case, you may want to explore this topic by yourself a little. I tried to explain the general idea, and for the sake of simplicity, left out some technical details. 

If you got it all, then congratulations! Stay tuned for the upcoming posts ;)

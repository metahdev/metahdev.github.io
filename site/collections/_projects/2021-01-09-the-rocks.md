EduGrands is a project that provides comprehensive support for young people to apply for foreign programs and allows them to study abroad.

It is not just an information provider, but an absolutely free helper in the complete application process. For example, writing an essay, creating a CV, interviewing, etc.

So far, we have helped more than 1000 people to participate in many programs like FLEX, YYGS, TechGirls, UWC and we have built an audience of more than 6000 on social media. Currently, our content has more than 100,000 views per month (telegram statistics).

This project is very important to people. The interesting thing is that we got to this level in 1 year and without ads.

We currently have more than 10 researchers/copywriters/supporters and designers.

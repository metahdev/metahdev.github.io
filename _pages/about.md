Hi! My name is Askar, and I am a 2nd year Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences student at the University of California, Berkeley. I am originally from Atyrau, Kazakhstan.

I started developing iOS apps at the age of 14. For some time I enjoyed writing articles about it, and they are archived on this website. 

I have published several iOS apps (10,000+ total downloads) worked on large projects (including a banking software with 8M+ users), and founded a B2B company. You can see my full resume

I am a 16-years-old teenager from Atyrau, Kazakhstan.  

I started developing iOS apps at the age of 14 and instantly fell in love with the process. I also enjoy sharing with people, and thatâ€™s why I decided to start this blog.


#### Education  

I am currently studying at the Nazarbayev Intellectual School, graduation year - 2023. Here are some of my valuable academic awards: 
* 3rd place in the Republican contest of scientific projects
* A certificate for free training at [STEM Academy](https://https://stem-academia.com/en/main-page/)
* The Student of the Year of NIS Atyrau in Computer Science field(2019)  

In summer 2020, I also had an opportunity to participate in the [Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies](https://spcs.stanford.edu), studying the Artificial Intelligence program. You can view my program evaluation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gN9RR8BqSoJUCvbcjkcM13p5H3KIKhpq/view?usp=sharing). 


#### Projects

I am the founder and main developer of Qulynym. It is an educational mobile application in the Kazakh language for preschoolers. The app is available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/qulynym/id1535210352).


In May 2020, I participated in the Apple WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge. 
I was lucky enough to win the award with my project - the Dombra simulator. You can read more about it in this [article](https://bilimdinews.kz/?p=114024).


#### Work experience  

In July-August 2019, I had an internship at the IT company called ["AV-software"](https://avsoft.kz/) based in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

From May to July 2020, I had a part-time job at the delivery service ["Degreen"](https://degreen.kz/) as a junior iOS developer. It was my first major experience with a commercial project like this.

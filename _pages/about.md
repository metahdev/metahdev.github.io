I am a 16-years-old teenager from Atyrau, Kazakhstan.  I enjoy playing video games and cycling. My favorite music band is the Black Keys. 

I started developing iOS apps at the age of 14 and instantly fell in love with the process. I also enjoy sharing with people, and that’s why I decided to start this blog.
